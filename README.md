# Friend Router

The backend of Friend Router using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) and [Flask-RESTFul](http://github.com/twilio/flask-restful).

## Introduction

The main purpose of Friend Router is to simplify group meetups on campus. It is a mobile application, installed on the smart phone of each student (either on an Android phone or iPhone). The system allows students to post their status updates (in class or free), and check their friends' status, so that they can know which friends are potentially available for a meetup. At the same time, they can browse othersâ€™ location and choose friends that are close or on the way to the destination. Once a user have selected a list of friends and started to plan the details of a meetup, the system allows the user to send invitations to his or her friends, and eventually provides navigation to the destination. The interface is similar to most instant messaging applications, providing users familiar experiences.

## Installation

### Development

For development, it is recommended to use sqlite3 to reduce complexity. No additional setup is needed if the database is sqlite3.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ export FLASK_APP=friend_router
$ export FLASK_ENV=development

$ flask initdb
$ flask run
```
